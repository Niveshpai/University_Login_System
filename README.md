## Main Video

This is the final version of the video : [Leen University Login System](https://youtu.be/FkkWSYb2tEc)

## Inspiration
Due to the pandemic situation, most of the universities have closed down and have switched to online mode. A system for regular attendance of the professor and students has become a necessity. Students can also choose courses easily using given choices. </br>

## What it does
It is used by
1. Professor - To teach courses, allot courses, see the number of students the particular course 
2. Students - To choose courses, view registered courses </br>

## How I built it
I used python in Visual Studio Code to build the python code. Based on the knowledge of login system, I have created the python code. I have also used Canva to create the thumbnail down below. </br>

## Challenges I ran into
Primarily being a C developer, I am new to python. I faced problems with a lot of syntax errors, argument error, function error, and so on. It took me a lot of time to firstly find it and then rectify the same. </br>

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that I was able to learn a majority of python language. Usually, I take up days to understand certain parts of software but I was able to complete this within the mentioned deadline. </br>
 
## What I learned
I learned to code in Python. I learnt tons of basic functions, tricks, syntax formatting et cetera. Furthermore, I also improved my image editing skills.. </br>

## What's next for 'University Login System'
I look further to create a description of the courses offered. Add more functions to track the log-in time of student and professor, delete/edit course by students and professors.  </br>
